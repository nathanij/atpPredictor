# atpPredictor
Contains all code used for building and using a tennis match predicting model.
Accuracy of the model depends on how long you have to train it, but with my maximum of 12 hours runtime I have already gotten the model to show positive results, that would be profitable if used to be over a certain confidence threshold.
All the data used to train the model was either calculated from or included in the data in Jeff Sackmann's repository linked here, https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp. A clone of the repository used for the training is in my repositories.
